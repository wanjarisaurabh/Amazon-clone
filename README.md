**Project Description: Amazon Clone Website**

In this project, I've created a clone of Amazon's homepage using only HTML and CSS, recreating the structure and design elements of the original website. This project showcases various sections typically found on an e-commerce site, including:

1. **Header Section**: Contains a fully functional navigation bar with a logo placeholder, delivery location option, search bar, sign-in and returns options, and a cart icon. Each element is styled to closely resemble Amazon's real interface.

2. **Panel Section**: Displays quick-access links for essential Amazon services like "Today's Deals," "Customer Service," "Register," "Gift Cards," and "Sell." This panel makes navigation intuitive and user-friendly.

3. **Hero Section**: A promotional banner with a message and call-to-action link, similar to Amazon's approach of highlighting new deals or services on their homepage.

4. **Shop Section**: This grid section displays different product categories such as Clothes, Health & Personal Care, Electronics, Furniture, Beauty, Pets Care, Toys, and Fashion. Each category is displayed in a box with an image background and a "See more" link, offering a clean and organized way for users to explore various items.

5. **Footer Section**: Divided into multiple panels, the footer includes sections for “Get to Know Us,” “Make Money with Us,” “Amazon Payment Products,” and additional links for conditions, privacy, and ad choices, echoing the extensive footer found on Amazon.

### Features & Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structured content with headers, paragraphs, images, and lists for a clean, organized layout.
- **CSS**: Styling with Flexbox for alignment, custom colors, font styles, and responsive elements to enhance user experience.
- **Font Awesome**: Used for icons to mimic Amazon’s icons, such as the location, search, and cart icons.

This project demonstrates my understanding of responsive design principles, component structuring, and modern CSS techniques to create a visually appealing and functional clone of a real-world website.
